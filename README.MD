## FAQ

#### Is this officially supported by GitHub?

**No**. JetBrains Copilot is a third-party plugin and has **no affiliation with GitHub**.
As such, use it at your own risk, as we use some internal APIs from the Visual Studio Code plugin.

#### How long will this be maintained?

The plugin will be maintained until GitHub creates their own official plugin.
