# JetBrains Copilot

GitHub Copilot support for the IntelliJ Platform.

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE**
> 
> Yes, this is my first IntelliJ plugin. All things considered, I didn't expect it
> to become as popular as it is currently, but here we are. It started off as a
> quick hack to have some simple autocompletion, meant for private use really.
> 
> Given my lack of familiarity with the IntelliJ Platform SDK, I'm unable to
> provide a lot of support for the plugin itself, namely in terms of diagnosing
> issues. I'd expect that Copilot will get an official plugin when it is fully
> released, hopefully without the shortcomings of this current hack.
> 
> To end off this short monologue, **thank you** for all the support on this project.
> I will do update where possible, but given my lack of familiarity some features/fixes
> may not be feasible for me to implement.

## FAQ

#### Is this officially supported by GitHub?

**No**. JetBrains Copilot is a third-party plugin and has **no affiliation with GitHub**.
As such, use it at your own risk, as we use some internal APIs from the Visual Studio Code plugin.

#### How long will this be maintained?

The plugin will be maintained until GitHub creates their own official plugin.
